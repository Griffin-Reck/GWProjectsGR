<h1> Falling Spike Game </h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Griffin Reck. This website will teach you and inform you about the game that I have created. The game I have created is called spike game. I named the game falling spike game because it was a project for school and the game is avoiding the spikes that fall from the sky or in this case the top of your screen. I hope you enjoy this website and the game that I have created.</p> <br>
